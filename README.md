## You should probably be using the mod instead
Clientcommands is a client-side mod which can do the same thing as this tool, but it's much less error prone.
Unless you specifically want to avoid using a mod, you should probably use the mod instead.

Links for clientcommands:
- [Download](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/clientcommands/releases)
  - First install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/), then download clientcommands and [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and put them both into your mods folder.

## Installation Instructions
Download the latest zip file from [the releases page](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker/releases)
and extract into a place you won't lose it, such as your Desktop.

If you're a Windows user, you should double-click the batch file in the `bin` folder. Batch files
have a cog icon next to their name.

If you're not using Windows, you should instead run the other file in the `bin` folder (called `enchcracker`,
not `enchcracker.bat`). How to "run" a shell script like this may differ from system to system and I
can't give instructions for every system.

You must have Java installed to run the enchantment cracker. You may install Java
from [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## Reporting Bugs
Feel free to report bugs and ask any questions you may have on
[the issue tracker](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker/issues), but
make sure to *search* whether anyone has reported your bug or asked
your question before.

## Building from Source
Assuming you have `git` installed, run the following commands from the
Command Prompt/Terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/Earthcomputer/EnchantmentCracker
cd EnchantmentCracker
gradlew build
```
On Linux/MacOS, run `./gradlew build` instead of `gradlew build`.

The resulting zip file may be found in the `build/distributions` folder.

Alternatively you can run directly from source without building, using
the `gradlew run` command.

## Contributing
All (sensible) contributions are welcome!

If you use Eclipse, run `gradlew eclipse` to generate an Eclipse project,
then use `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace` inside
Eclipse. Navigate to the EnchantmentCracker folder and click import.

If you use IntelliJ IDEA, it can import the Gradle project directly.

Most contributions are accepted via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

If you want to add translations to the project, you are welcome to do so!
You do this by adding a new `.properties` file under `resources/i18n`
representing your added language, then create a pull request adding that file.
As creating a pull request may be tricky if you are not used to coding,
translators may instead create an issue and upload their properties file, and
I will add it in myself.

Note that if you do make translations, I will not be able to update most of them in line
with the default English translations, as I do not speak those languages, so you may have
to keep them updated yourself.
